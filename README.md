# Portfolio description
## Purpose & Target audience
The purpose of this portfolio is to present myself to the world as an IT professional by providing potential employers with information about my skills, interests, and knowledge, as well as providing a showcase of my work.

## Functionality/features
Current functionality of the website is limited to a navigation bar and menu. The bar has a button in the top left which, when clicked, brings down a drop down menu the with options to navigate around the website. The Nav bar and menu both rely entirely on HTML and scss to function, there is no scripting in this website as of today.

The lack of scripting in the website means that the contact form currently doesn't work. Once i have developed my skills further i intend to add scripts to this website so that the form works as well improve the existing nav bar/menu.
I also plan on a "post blog form" once i have the nessassary skills.
